You can upload the report to SERVER using Reporting Service script (RSS). Please check the PublishAnalysisReport.rss for further detail!!!
1. Open command prompt
2. Move to the directory where the script  exists(RSS script)
3. Run the script with the suitable parameters (see the PublishAnalysisReport.rss)
4. Note: with the filePath parameter, you HAVE TO USE the slash ("/") instead of ("\") to input the path where the Reports exist. 
And also, you HAVE TO END the path with "/" (end Report Folder)
